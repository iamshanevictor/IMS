### Why is this helpful ?

After you graduate and get a job at a software company, the first thing that you'll encounter is the version control system. Git is the most commonly used as a version control system. But there are other alternatives such as Mercurial, SVN and Helix core. 

Now, GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. In other words, this is where you store your Git repositories.
